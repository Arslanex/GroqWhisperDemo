# Groq Transcribe: Module Details and Limitations

## Module Overview

Groq Transcribe is a comprehensive audio transcription library that leverages the Groq Cloud API and Whisper models to convert audio files into text with advanced features and robust validation.

## Supported Whisper Models

- `whisper-large-v3-turbo`
- `distil-whisper-large-v3-en`
- `whisper-large-v3`

## Audio File Limitations

### Supported File Formats
- MP3
- MP4
- MPEG
- MPGA
- M4A
- WAV
- WebM

### Size and Duration Constraints
- **Maximum File Size**: 25 MB
- **Minimum File Length**: 0.01 seconds
- **Minimum Billed Length**: 10 seconds
  - Files shorter than 10 seconds will be billed for a full 10 seconds

### Audio Channel Handling
- Multiple audio tracks are detected
- Only the first audio track will be transcribed
- A warning is printed when multiple tracks are detected

## Response Formats

- `json`: Basic JSON with transcription text
- `verbose_json`: Detailed JSON with timestamps and segments
- `text`: Plain text transcription

## Language Support

- Automatic language detection
- Optional language hint can be provided
- Supports multiple languages based on Whisper model capabilities

## Performance Considerations

### Computational Resources
- Transcription speed depends on:
  - Audio file length
  - Selected Whisper model
  - Network latency
  - Groq Cloud API processing time

### API Rate Limits
- Consult Groq Cloud API documentation for current rate limits
- Implement exponential backoff for retry mechanisms

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- File not found
- Unsupported file format
- File size exceeds limit
- Audio duration too short

### API Errors
- Authentication failures
- Network issues
- API request timeouts

## Security Considerations

- API key should be stored securely (environment variables, .env file)
- Partial masking of API key in logs
- No sensitive information is logged or stored

## Debugging and Logging

- Detailed error messages
- Debug print statements for audio file properties
- Informative exceptions with specific error details

## Known Limitations

- Transcription accuracy depends on audio quality
- Background noise can affect transcription
- Accented or specialized vocabulary may reduce accuracy
- No real-time transcription support
- Limited to audio file transcription (no streaming)

## Recommended Practices

1. Use high-quality audio files
2. Minimize background noise
3. Provide language hints for better accuracy
4. Handle potential errors gracefully
5. Implement retry mechanisms for transient API errors

## Future Improvements

- Enhanced language detection
- Support for more audio formats
- Improved noise reduction
- Real-time transcription support
- More granular error handling
